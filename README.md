# Depth-First Traversal


By [Liam Buell](https://github.com/Lbuell/)

----
Because of recent security breaches, Apple has decided that each member of their executive team can only handle overseeing 2 other people at a time. 

They are restructuring, to look like this:
Name 	Report 1 	Report 2
Tim 	Jony 	Phil
Phil 	Craig 	Eddie
Jony 	Dan 	Katie
Katie 	Peter 	

Andrea

 

This table isn't very DRY. It can be better represented by a binary tree. 

Create a data structure in Ruby to represent this data.

Now display the data. There are 3 ways to do "depth-first" traversal of a tree: have your data structure display the data in each of the 3 ways.

## Installation

Fork and clone the repo and, run DFS.rb in console
